# Environment Tokens

Secrets aren't supposed to be read by only humans. Sometimes, even machines need to fetch and read them. But you can't save your account password in your scripts or CI/CD pipelines, right? That'd be too dangerous.

To solve this issue, envsecrets allows you to generate ephemeral read-only tokens for a specific environment. These tokens allow you to authenticate the CLI against our APIs and export your secrets securely.

```sh
envs export --token [your-secure-token]
```
