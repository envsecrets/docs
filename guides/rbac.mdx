While inviting users to your organisation, you can choose which specific role to assign them.
Each role has specific permissions attached to it. And every member of your organisation is only allowed to perform actions which their role has permissions for.

You can also optionally **create custom roles** and choose a tailored set of permissions that will apply to them.

Never again let your interns read those production secrets!
