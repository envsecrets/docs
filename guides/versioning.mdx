description: Overview of how we protect your secrets.

Everytime you create/mutate your secrets, that change is reflected in a new version of your secrets.
This allows for easy rollbacks in case you made a mistake.

Additionally, changelogs are auto-generated whenever your team members mutate the secrets. This helps in auditing.
