# Security

## Data Model

### User

* Every new user is issued an AES 256 bit public-private key pair.

#### Keys Backup

* We encrypt your private key with a separate symmetric "protection" key. This new "protection" key is in turn protected with your account password using [Argon2i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2), which can derive cryptographic keys from passwords and was selected as the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition.
* Now your public key, encrypted private key, encrypted protection key and hashed account password are stored on our servers.
* Whenever you login from a different machine, your key pair is downloaded from our servers, decrypted locally using your account password and saved in your machine.

### Organisation

* Every new organisation is issued a fresh symmetric key.&#x20;
* All secrets in this organisation are encrypted with it's key using the industry standard [NaCL](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/secretbox.html)'s [secretbox package](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/secretbox) which uses `XSalsa20` and `Poly1305` to encrypt and authenticate messages with secret-key cryptography.

## Architecture&#x20;

### Authentication

* Running `envs login` from the CLI installs your public-private key pair locally after decrypting it with your account password.
* Running `envs init` in the project root directory, saves the project configuration in that directory along with installing your encrypted copy of the chosen organisation's key.

### Collaboration

* When a new member is invited to your organisation, they are issued a copy of the organisation's key encrypted with their own (invitee's) public key using NaCL's [box package](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box) which, in turn uses `Curve25519`, `XSalsa20` and `Poly1305` to encrypt and authenticate messages. And this copy is stored on our servers.

### Cryptography

* When a member does `envs set KEY=value` from the CLI, their locally stored copy of the organisation's key is first decrypted using their private key, then the secret **value** is encrypted with the decrypted key. This key-value pair is then uploaded on our servers.
* Vice versa, when they do `envs get KEY`, the encrypted secret value is downloaded from our servers and decrypted using the locally stored copy of organisation's encryption key.

## Access Protection

We have carefully implemented very specific row-level and column-level security on our transactional database to ensure only the data and relationships belonging to you are accessible by you. And no one else can gain visibility into your rows.

To validate your access to specific rows and columns, we use the conventional method of reading claims from your post-login identity token.

## Statement

As a secrets manager, we are deeply committed to enforcing the privacy and security of all users and data on the platform but acknowledge that it is virtually impossible to guarantee perfect security; unfortunately, even the most secure systems have vulnerabilities.

As part of our commitment, we do our best to maintain platform privacy and security, notify users if anything goes wrong, and rectify adverse situations immediately if anything happens. As Infisical grows, we will be adding more opt-in security measures to ensure better data protection and maintain trust within the growing community. With that, letâ€™s make the most simple and secure secrets management system out there!
