# Overview

Our platform smoothly supports integrating third-party services for uni-directional syncing. Implying, every time you update your secrets in envsecrets, the new values will automatically be synced with your external services.

For example, if you connected a Github Actions integration in your organisation and enabled it on any environment of your project, your secrets will be synced/pushed to your Github repository's Actions secrets. Which, in turn, you can natively access in your Actions/Workflow pipelines.

Whenever you connect a new integration, we have to **temporarily** decrypt your secrets to transfer them forward to your chosen integration.

This is a momentary operation and NO decrypted secrets are persisted or saved anywhere in our database once this syncing is complete.
