## Strong Security

To ensure we provide best-in-class encryptions and overall security, we use [Hashicorp's Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) deeply integrated into the rest of our infrastructure.
We paid deep attention to the minutest of details. Everything from the type of encryption keys to use to access control. [Read more](/security/overview) about our security apparatus in detail.

## Role-based Access Control


## Secrets Versioning


## External Integrations

Our platform smoothly supports integrating third-party services for uni-directional syncing.
Implying, everytime you update your secrets in envsecrets, the new values will automatically be synced with your external services.

For example, if you connected a Github Actions integration in your organisation and enabled it on any environment of your project,
your secrets will be synced/pushed to your Github repository's Actions secrets. Which, in turn, you can natively access in your Actions/Workflow pipelines.
